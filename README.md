# Breakfast club

A place for üç©'s and maybe üç∞'s

## Getting Started

- Fork the repository
- Clone it down
- `npm install`
- `npm run test`
  - Try to get all the tests to pass!
- `git branch [yourNickname]-solutions`
  - This branch will be the branch you'll be working off of -- just so we can keep things organized. You *don't* have to push your code up but it would be cool to be able to go through all the available solutions and compare answers. Maybe you have an awesome solution? Would be cool to share!
- Once you have a solution feel free to open a pull request to this repository

## Schedule

This club operates once a week and attendance is optional. I'll typically post the question of the week on a Thursday and then on the following week I'll post the answer.
