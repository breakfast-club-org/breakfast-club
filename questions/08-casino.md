Using the previous code, create a UI around `06-shuffle.js` and `07-deck.js`. I wanted to leave this open as an opportunity for you to explore new technologies, you could go as simple as using `codepen` or go all the way and build this around a framework. This is entirely up to you in this case. Ultimately we can discuss what sort of features we want to add to the build but I generally would just want to see the things below

*Possible options*
- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- [Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli)
- [Ember](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/getting-started/quick-start/)
- [Codepen](https://codepen.io)

*Tasks*
- [ ] Build your casino UI
- [ ] Style it how you see fit, have fun with it!
- [ ] Add a button
- [ ] Bind a click event to it that ties the draw cards method
- [ ] The cards drawn should be displayed on the UI
- [ ] Maybe add an animation?
- [ ] Add a reset button
- [ ] When clicked you should be able to start over
